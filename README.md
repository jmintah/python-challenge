# Python-Challenge

PyBank Project:

From the "budget_data_csv" data set, a python code was created from the "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The Python code scripted the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. Which aligned based off results given in the "budget_data" text.

PyPoll Project:

From the "election_data.csv" data set, a python code was created from the data set columns of "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The Python code scripted the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote. Which aligned based off results given in the "election_data." text.
